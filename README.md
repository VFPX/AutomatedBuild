# Automated Build
**Automate your Visual FoxPro application builds using extensions to CruiseControl.NET**

Project Manager: Markus Winhard

Build automation, continuous integration...

This project is mainly an extension for CruiseControl.NET, written in Visual FoxPro. It should also work with Team Foundation Server. The goals of the project include: provide the environment for a build server that can build Visual FoxPro projects without an interactive user sitting in front of it, record build errors, and so on.

Tools work in both Visual FoxPro 9 and 8. It’s already in production at several sites, each building several projects from different developers for many months and works flawlessly. 

This project is completely separate and different from the VFPX MSBuild project.
